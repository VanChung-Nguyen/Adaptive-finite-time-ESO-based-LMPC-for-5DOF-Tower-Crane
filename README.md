# Adaptive finite-time extended state observer-based model predictive control with flatness-motivated motion planning for tower cranes
This simulation demonstrates a novel methodology for controlling a 5DOF Tower Crane in Matlab/Simulink. Several comparison methods, including PID-AFT-ESO, LQR-AFT-ESO, and SO-SMC-AFT-ESO, are also included. 
The Simscape model of the 5DOF Tower Crane is proposed as follows:

We utilized the model from [open sources Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/tower-crane-with-trolley-and-hoist.html) to create an accurate Tower Crane model based on the mathematical representation.

## Software Requirements & Setup
The simulation is designed in Matlab
